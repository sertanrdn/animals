The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. It can digest starch and is mostly herbivorous with a diet consisting almost entirely of bamboo and bamboo shoots.
